<p>In <b>Number of images of one line</b>, select how many images you want to place in a single line. <br> Both horizontal and vertical values can be selected from drop-down lists. <br> For each dimension, you can select 8, 16, 32, 64, or 16. <br> If you select the <b>same value</b> option, when you choose a value for <b>Vertical</b>, the same value is also selected for <b>Horizontal.</b> </p>
<p>In <b>The alpha channel is processed</b>, select whether to enable or disable alpha channel processing. </p>
<p>In <b>The pixel edge is painted out with the black</b>, select whether to fill the edge pixels of each frame of the collected images. <br> Select <b>Color Channel</b> to paint the one pixel at the edge with black. <br> Select <b>Alpha Channel</b> to paint the one pixel at the edge of the alpha channel with black. <br> This <b>Alpha Channel</b> option only works when <b>The alpha channel is processed</b> is enabled. </p><br> <br><h3 id="collect_notes">Notes </h3>

<h4 id="collect_interp">Image Interpolation Methods </h4>
<p>Use <b>Bilinear</b> for the interpolation method when enlarging or reducing an image. </p>
