<h1>Installing the Photoshop Plug-Ins </h1>

<p>Follow this procedure when manually setting up the Photoshop plug-ins. </p>
<p>If you are using Installer to install or uninstall the plug-ins, the following procedure is not necessary. <br>(At this time, no installer has been prepared.) </p>

<h2>Installation Procedure </h2>
<h3>Exit Photoshop </h3>
<p>Exit Photoshop if it is currently running. <br> Exit Adobe Bridge if it is currently running. </p>

<h3>Copying Files </h3>
<p>Copy the <CODE>NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin</CODE> folder (located in <CODE>(NintendoWare for CTR_installation_folder)\tools\DccPlugin\Photoshop</CODE>) to one of the following locations. </p>
<table class="arguments"><tbody><tr><td>・For Photoshop CS2:<br>(Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins\Adobe Photoshop Only\<br><br>・For Photoshop CS3:<br>(Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins<br><br>・For Photoshop CS4:<br>(Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins<br><br>・For Photoshop CS5:<br>Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins </td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3>Copying Files (64-Bit Version) </h3>
<p>Copy the <CODE>NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin_64</CODE> folder (located in <CODE>(NintendoWare for CTR_installation_folder)\tools\DccPlugin\Photoshop</CODE>) to one of the following locations. </p>
<table class="arguments"><tbody><tr><td>・For Photoshop CS4 (64 bit):<br>Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins<br><br>・For Photoshop CS5 (64 bit):<br>Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><br>If Adobe Bridge is installed, copy <CODE>NW4C_ctex.8bi</CODE> from the <CODE>(NintendoWare for CTR_installation_folder)\tools\DccPlugin\Photoshop\NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin</CODE> folder to the following location. CTEX file thumbnails can be displayed when using Adobe Bridge. </p>
<table class="arguments"><tbody><tr><td><strong>(Adobe Bridge installation folder)\Plug-Ins\</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><br>This completes the installation. <br> <br>If the plug-ins have been installed correctly, <b>NintendoWare for CTR</b> is added to <b>Filter</b> menu of Photoshop. <br> To open the manuals for the plug-ins, select <b>Help</b> &gt; <b>About Plug-in</b> &gt; <b>NW4C_xxxx</b> (for example NW4C_Tga). A PhotoShop dialog box appears. In the dialog box, click <b>Help Index</b>. </p>

<h2>Uninstalling </h2>
<p>Exit Photoshop if it is running, and then delete all folders that you copied to the <CODE>NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin</CODE> folder (or to the <CODE>NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin_64</CODE> folder) at installation time. <br> If Adobe Bridge is running, exit and delete the <CODE>NW4C_ctex.8bi </CODE> file that was copied during installation. <br> This completes the uninstall process. </p>
