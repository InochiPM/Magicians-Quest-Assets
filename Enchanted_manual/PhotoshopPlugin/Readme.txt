NintendoWare for CTR
Photoshop Plug-Ins (Windows Version) (2014/09/25)
=============================================

If you are creating images for themes, you must export the files as texture files that can be used with NintendoWare for CTR. 
 You can create these kinds of texture files by using the following procedure to install the plug-ins. 

 * Installing the Plug-Ins
   - Quit Photoshop.
     If Photoshop is running, exit the program. 
     Exit Adobe Bridge if it is currently running. 

   - Copy files.
     Copy the NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin folder to the following location. 
     (If you are using the 64-bit version of Photoshop, copy the NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin_64 folder.) Copy the folder to the following location. 
  --------------------------------------------------------------
     □ For Photoshop CS2:
     (Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins\Adobe Photoshop Only\
     
     □ For Photoshop CS3:
     (Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins
     
     □ For Photoshop CS4:
     (Photoshop_installation_folder)\Plug-ins\
     
     □ For Photoshop CS5:
     (Photoshop_installation_folder))\Plug-ins\
  --------------------------------------------------------------

     If Adobe Bridge is  installed, copy NW4C_ctex.8bi from the NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin folder to the following location. 
     CTEX file thumbnails can be displayed when using Adobe Bridge. 
  --------------------------------------------------------------
     (Adobe Bridge_installation_folder)\Plug-Ins\
  --------------------------------------------------------------

     This completes the installation process. 
     If the plug-ins have been installed correctly, NintendoWare for CTR is added to the Filter menu of Photoshop.



 * Uninstalling the Plug-Ins
   Exit Photoshop if it is running, and delete the folder that you copied to the NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin folder (or to the NW4C_Photoshop_Plugin_64 folder) at installation time. 
   If Adobe Bridge is running, exit and delete the NW4C_ctex.8bi file that was copied during installation.
